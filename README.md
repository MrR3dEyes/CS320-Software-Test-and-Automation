How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? 
  To ensure my code is functional, I implemented comprehensive JUnit tests across all three core service modules. Each test validates both normal and edge case inputs and helps confirm that data validation, immutability, and proper logic all behaved correctly. I managed to achieve around a 90% code coverage, which helped verify functionality and prevent undetected defects. For proper security, I enforced input constraints and validated identifiers, and also prevented invalid or unsafe data from being processed. This all helped in ensuring that the software is both stable and secure. 


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  I interpreted the users' needs by aligning the tests and logic to the software's requirements and documentation. For example, the users needed to create, update, and delete contacts or appointments with solid data validation. I saw those needs and translated them into technical constraints such as maximum name lengths, proper phone number formats, and preventing appointments from being in the past. By testing from the user's perspective and validating these rules, I ensured that the system behaved in a user-friendly way that reflects their expectations. 

How do I approach designing software?
  My approach to software design begins with understanding the requirements first. Being able to understand what the end user wants and the requirements lets me set a foundation for the software. I then begin development and focus on testing and ensuring classes are modular and easy to validate through unit tests. Efficiency and maintainability were also on my mind during development, as being able to reuse methods and helper functions, as well as parameterized tests, helped prevent duplication. Finally, I also thought about discipline and continuous improvement, testing thoroughly to build technically sound, scalable, and secure solutions that aligned with professional standards and the users' end needs.
